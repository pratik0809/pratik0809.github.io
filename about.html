<p>This website is my collection of experiments on web development, photography techniques, fitness routines, or silly DIY projects.

<p id="subtitle">Am I fit yet?</p>

<p>Besides writing about building websites and muscles, my DIY experiments on home automation, carpentry, and electronics take up nearly all of my free time. Got a spare microwave? or refrigerator? or car? Please let me tear it apart :pray:. Or wanna work with me on a project? <a class="link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">Message me</a>.</p>

<p>Thought I'd let you go without a great pun?</p>
