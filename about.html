<h2>Hi.</h2>

<p>I'm Pratik. I am a:
		<ul>
			<li>Front-End Web Developer</li>
			<li>Photographer</li>
			<li>Gym Rat</li>
			<li>DIY Fan</li>
			<li><span class="hint--bottom hint--rounded hint--medium" aria-label="What kind of computer says hello from the other side? A Dell."><em>Huge fan of puns</em></span></li>
		</ul>
</p>
<p>This website is my collection of experiments on web development, photography techniques, fitness routines, or silly DIY projects. My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/">blog posts</a> are 5 minute reads on specific topics like <a href="" class="hint--bottom hint--rounded hint--small" aria-label="Coming soon!">Arrays</a>, <a href="" class="hint--bottom hint--rounded hint--small" aria-label="Coming Soon!">the Rule of Thirds</a>, <a href="" class="hint--bottom hint--rounded hint--small" aria-label="Coming Soon!">Body Fat Percentage</a>, or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/diy/how-to-build-a-standing-desk-for-50">Making a $50 standing desk</a>.</p>

<p>Why web dev you ask? Building digital representations has me hooked.  While I still have a lot to learn, I look forward to constant skill improvement. However, I have long pondered an important question many web developers have thought about: <b>Why do most developers go broke?</b> And after much thought through out the years, I have realized why: Because they use up all their...<span class="hint--bottom-left hint--rounded hint--medium" aria-label="I'm sorry, don't leave my website pls."><em>cache</em></span>.</p>

<p>If you didn't get the pun in the last sentence, I'm sorry we can't be friends. If you groaned, facepalmed or laughed till you fell off your chair, congratulations. Your level of humor is as sophisticated as mine.</p>

<p>Along with the nerdy web stuff, I am always looking for the next best way to "capture the moment". I frequently toy around with GoPros, drones, and DSLRs to chase after preserving my favorite moments. In the end, my work teaches me valuable lessons in photography and videography that I hope to share through my posts.</p>

<p>Pursuing peak physical condition has been one of my longest standing challenges. I guess it's the journey, not the destination.  My blog posts on fitness aim to document my attempts at shredding fat, muscle training, new motivation techniques and improving flexibility.</p>

<p>Besides writing about building websites and muscles, my DIY experiments on home automation, carpentry, and electronics take up nearly all of my free time. Got a spare microwave? or refrigerator? or car? Please let me tear it apart :pray:. Or wanna work with me on a project? <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">Message me</a>.</p>

<p>Thought I'd let you go without a great pun?</p>
